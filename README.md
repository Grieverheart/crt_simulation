A simulation of a black and white CRT TV using OpenGL and C++. See [http://nicktasios.nl/posts/simulating-a-crt-tv-with-c%2B%2B-and-opengl.html](http://nicktasios.nl/posts/simulating-a-crt-tv-with-c%2B%2B-and-opengl.html) for an explanation of how I implemented the simulation.

# Building

Build with Cmake. OpenGL, SDL2, and GLEW are required for building.
